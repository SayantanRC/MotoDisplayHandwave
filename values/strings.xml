    <string name="FAQ">FAQ</string>
    <string name="q1.1">This app doesn\'t activate Moto Display\nOR\nThere is a constant Pad lock sign in Moto Display.</string>
    <string name="a1.1">There is no proper fix to both these issues, and occurs sporadically across devices. Make sure:\n
        • Your Moto Display is always updated
    </string>
    <string name="a1.2">Check Moto Diplay on Google Play Store</string>
    <string name="a1.3">• You have not kept the Moto Display off or kept the \"Keep screen off\" option turned on.\n
    • Moto Display for your device is bugged (sorry Moto X1 users). Wait for Motorola to release a fix :(\n
        • For ANDROID OREO check that you have not disabled the \"WakeUp\" channel notifications. To check, click the hamburger menu:
    </string>
    <string name="a1.4">Click \"Preferences\" -> \"Manage app notifications\" and enable toggle for\n\"WakeUp (Do not deactivate)\"\n\n
    Recommended settings in Moto Display:
    </string>
    <string name="q2">Moto Display keeps flashing on my device.</string>
    <string name="a2">This has been seen on Moto E4 series. This can be a problem in the Moto Display app itself or the proximity sensor. This version should fix the issue.</string>
    <string name="q3">Why do I get the \"MotoDisplay Handwave is running\" notification?</string>
    <string name="a3">In Android Oreo, this notification is necessary to make the user aware that an app is running in background which can potentially decrease battery life of the device. However this app doesn\'t use a lot of your resources. Read the next answer for details.</string>
    <string name="q4">Does this app consume a lot of battery?</string>
    <string name="a4">This app consumes minimum (very close to zero) power when the screen is off in MOTOROLA DEVICES WITH MOTO DISPLAY TURNED ON.\n
    This is because Moto Display actually keeps the proximity sensor turned on always, but doesn\'t use this wave gesture.\n
        For non-moto devices, this app may drain some battery as the proximity sensor is always on, especially if \"Wave-n-hold for screen off\" feature is on. Please read the next answer.
    </string>
    <string name="q5">How much power does this app exactly consume?</string>
    <string name="a5.1">You can check the battery consumption by clicking the hamburger menu</string>
    <string name="a5.2">Click \"Device info\" and check \"Power used since last boot\". You will find that not a lot of power is drained by the app, often less than 1mAh.</string>

    <string name="a6">@string/integrationsAnswer</string>
    <string name="q7">Why was ads added? I liked the app as free!</string>
    <string name="a7">Ads have been added to support further development of the app. Also the ads can be disabled easily, without needing to buy anything! Keeping the ads on serves as an incentive as the app will continue receiving exciting features via Integrations.</string>
    <string name="ql">There is some other problem</string>
    <string name="al.1">Click the hamburger menu</string>
    <string name="al.2">And select \"Contact over email\". Please provide details about your exact problem, device and model number.</string>

    To use an integration, download the app from Google Play Store, open the app and set it up (grant permission etc.) then return to this app and enable the available options.\n\n
